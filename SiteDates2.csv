Pueblo Grande,Hohokam,1000,1000-1500,450,1450,1200,1350,Mitchell 1994; Abbott et al. 1994,Most of the evidence of occupation is from 900-1450 but there is continuity in the use of plazas and cemetaries going all the way back to the Estrella phase. It was probably a small village until around 900.
Pueblo Bonito,Chaco Canyon,400,100-200,825,1225,1040,1100,Crown and Wills 2018; Windes 1993,This is the date of the main Pueblo structure at Pueblo Bonito. There are some earlier Basketmaker III remains in the area but it is unclear how they relate to the main structure and there may be an early Pueblo I period discontinuity. Dates based on a combination of tree-ring dates and ceramic materials as interpreted by Crown and Wills along with ceramic dates interpreted by me based on CyberSW data.
Hawwiku,Zuni,305,500-800,1375,1680,1400,1550,Kintigh 1985; Woodbury and Woodbury 1966,There is an earlier occupation underneath this settlement but the available evidence suggest there was a hiatus of 200 years or more between that early structure and the well documented later structure. The settlement was depopulated during the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 as the inhabitants joined the residents of the other 6 Zuni villages on Dowa Yallane and eventually the contemporary Zuni Pueblo.
Orayvi,Hopi,870,1000-1500,1150,2020,1350,1700,Bernardini et al. in press; Hargrave 1937; Whiteley 1992,Site has evidence of continuous occupation from the mid 12th century and some structures in buildings in use in the 20th century have dated beams from the 14th century
