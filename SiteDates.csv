Pueblo Grande,Hohokam/U.S. Southwest,450,1450,1200,1350,Mitchell 1994; Abbott et al. 1994,Most of the evidence of occupation is from 900-1450 but there is apparently some continuity in the use of plazas from earlier Estrella phase houses
Honey Bee Village,Hohokam/U.S. Southwest,750,1300,900,1050,Wallace 2012,Probably the most thoroughly excavated Hohokam village in modern times. Tons of absolute dates
Pueblo Bonito,Chaco Canyon/U.S. Southwest,825,1225,1040,1100,Crown and Wills 2018; Windes 1993,This is the date of the main structure at Pueblo Bonito. There are some earlier Basketmaker III remains in the area but it is unclear how they relate to the main structure. Dates based on a combination of tree-ring dates and ceramic materials
Hawwiku,Zuni/U.S. Southwest,1375,1680,1400,1550,Kintigh 1985; Woodbury and Woodbury 1966,There is an earlier occupation underneath this settlement but the available evidence suggest there was a hiatus of 200 years or more between that early structure and the well documented later structure. The settlement was depopulated during the Pueblo Revolt in 1680
Scribe S,Zuni/U.S. Southwest,1225,1285,1240,1285,"Schachner 2007, 2011","This is a well-dated site with hundreds of tree ring dates supporting this very short occupation as is true of other sites in the El Morro Valley, despite having more than 400 rooms"
Orayvi,Hopi Mesas/U.S. Southwest,1150,2020,1350,1906,Bernardini et al. in press; Hargrave 1937; Whiteley 1992,Site has evidence of continuous occupation from the mid 12th century and some structures in buildings in use in the 20th century have dated beams from the 14th century
Sand Canyon Pueblo,Northern San Juan/U.S. Southwest,1245,1280,1250,1280,Kuckelman 2007,Very well dated extensively excavated site with a short occupation typical of late canyon head villages in the Mesa Verde region
Walatowa,Jemez/U.S. Southwest,1696,2020,1900,2020,Liebmann 2016; Palkovich 1985 ,Pueblo settled after the Pueblo revolt. Population highest in the 20th century to present. Still never reached population of earlier pre-contact Jemez villages
